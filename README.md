# Background (Why we built this project)
Philadelphia, as the former capital of the United States and the place where the Declaration of Independence was signed, attracts thousands of visitors every year. Beyond museums and other “official” heritage venues, the historic neighborhoods nearby also carry meaningful informal histories and everyday cultural life. Community spirit and lived experience can complement formal narratives of the city.

We hope visitors can explore local neighborhoods to better understand community history and everyday life—and, through that, gain a deeper understanding of Philadelphia’s local culture.

To make this possible, the goal of this project is to collect valuable local knowledge from residents. We want to learn which places matter and why, so the planning department can support improvements such as:
- Shared public spaces for residents and visitors to rest, learn, and connect
- Safer and more comfortable walking routes for neighborhood tours

# Dashboard Design
This project has two main challenges:
1) The information we want to collect is abstract (Questions like: Which location has the strongest sense of place? Which place means the most to you? )—how do we help users understand what we’re asking for?  
2) The information we are trying to collect is much (where, why, and how to improve), which can feel long and tiring to complete.

Our solution is to use **gamified, scenario-based language and interactions** to make participation easier and more engaging. Users are invited to imagine taking a friend on a neighborhood walk: they plan stops and routes, explain why they chose them, and suggest what could be improved to make the experience better.

We also included a **Thank You Card** step: after users finish designing and submiting a tour, they will see a thank-you message where they can enter their name and download a thank-you card image. This positive feedback helps users feel the meaning and impact of their contribution.

# Statement
- ⚠️ Our dashboard displays user- generated content that has not undergone review, potentially posing content management risks.
- AI was used to help develop some features in this project, and all AI-generated outputs were reviewed and confirmed by the team.
